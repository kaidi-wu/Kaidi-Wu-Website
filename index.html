        <p class="lead mb-4">I am an international student. I came from China. I am now studying business economics right now at UCR, but I want to change my major into marketing. My dream is to be a successful business woman in the future. I am going to talk about things that impress the most when I was in high school. he activity for the tenth graders is cycling around Taiwan. Most of the students in our school live in the dormitory, and we barely have a chance to ride bicycles or have any concept of bicycle riding. From what I have learned before, the island of Taiwan is just a small island on the map. So none of us thought it is a big deal to ride around the island. However, unexpectedly, this is not the case. The small island we thought that looks small on the map, which took us about two weeks and around 900 km to ride! We could barely complete this difficult challenge.
 
We were on the road day and night, no matter it was raining or in bad weather, we continue our riding. The toughest day was to ride a mountain. It was very windy on that day. When I first set off and stopped waiting for the traffic lights. I was blown twice by the wind, and fallen down with my bike. My hands were injured because it hit the ground hard. Regardless of the pain, what moved me was that my classmates and teachers immediately threw their bicycles to lift me up when they saw me fall. I ride with three of my best friends. Since we are all skinning girls and cannot keep up with the boys in our class, we were far left behind. Instead of rushing to catch them, we rode slowly to maintain our strength. When it was halfway up to the mountain, the mountain was too steep. The distance between our small team and our class team was getting further and further. After a while, the four of us were exhausted and started walking like zombies while holding our heavy bicycles. As we walked, our energies seemed to disappear, we gave up and sat by the sideway to rest. A few minutes later, I recuperate some of the strengths and suggested that we should stand up again and push our bicycle to the meeting point slowly. But gradually, we found that pushing bicycles are more tiring than riding it. Just when we were about to give up, one of my friends got on the bike and started chanting slogans to cheer us up. We were instantly feeling full of strength to move on.
 
In the end, we successfully came to the meeting point and caught up with the class. This experience has a great impact on me. During the break, my teacher came to check my injuries. My little fingers were very swollen, so he suggested that I should go to the nearby hospital immediately. But I think this experience is very rare and valuable, plus I also think my hands were not as serious as it seemed so I refused and continue the riding.
 
After I finished the ride in the afternoon, I was accompanied by my teacher to the hospital to check my fingers. Fortunately, the doctor said my fingers are okay. The only thing to pay attention to is not to hurt my fingers anymore. The influence is enormous so that I cannot ignore it. After this trip, I learned that I can't give up things easily when I encounter any difficulties. As long as we work harder, there is nothing we cannot overcome. This unforgettable experience made me grow a lot. Not only did I learn the spirit of perseverance, but I also improved my self-consciousness in learning.
